    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::String
      - Initial version

0.06 Tues. Dec. 7, 2007
    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Base
      - added the &remove_accessors method to comply with the
        Class::MOP::Attribute interface
        - added test for this
      - the &install_accessors method now also properly assocaites
        the methods with the attribute, so they are accessible via
        introspection now.

0.05 Sat. Nov. 24, 2007
    - update Class::MOP dependency
    - hide the Moose::Meta::Attribute::Custom::* package
      declarations from search.cpan.org (when did they change
      things to start seeing these?? *sigh*)

0.04 Fri. Nov. 23, 2007
    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Base
      - changing this to use the new Class::MOP::Attribute
        reader and write method ref stuff.
      - fixed this to use find_or_create_type_constraint
        instead of trying to parse stuff on our own.

    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Collection
      - this is pretty much empty subclass now cause of
        the find_or_create_type_constraint fix above

    + MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Collection::ImmutableHash
    + MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Collection::Bag
      - added these two new collection types
        - added method provider roles for them
        - added tests for them

    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::MethodProvider::Hash
      - this is now composed from the ImmutableHash
        method provider

    * t/
      - fixed the plans on all the tests

0.03 Mon. Sept. 17, 2007
    ~~ more misc. doc updates ~~

    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Counter
      - now provides default attribute options for 'is',
      'isa', 'provides', and 'default' if not specified.

    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Base
      - added attribute $name to the params passed to
        process_options_or_provides(), which gives us more
	    flexibility when writing additional helpers
      - removed check for 'provides' and 'isa' attr
        options before _process_options. It should be
        called always.

    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::MethodProvider::Array
      - added `delete` and `insert` methods

0.02 Thurs. Sept. 13, 2007
    ~~ some misc. doc updates ~~

    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Base
      - now providing subrefs for the reader and writer
        methods to all the method provider constructors
        (this should speed things up quite a bit).
        - all method providers now use this internally

    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Counter
      - added the 'reset' method

    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Collection::Array
      - Extracted the List method provider role from
        Array and made Array consume List.

    + MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Collection::List
      - created the Collection::List metaclass
        derived from parts of the old Collection::Array
