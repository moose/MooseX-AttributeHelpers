      - Initial version

    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Base
      - added the &remove_accessors method to comply with the
        Class::MOP::Attribute interface
        - added test for this
      - the &install_accessors method now also properly assocaites

    - update Class::MOP dependency
    - hide the Moose::Meta::Attribute::Custom::* package

      things to start seeing these?? *sigh*)

0.04 Fri. Nov. 23, 2007
    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Base
      - changing this to use the new Class::MOP::Attribute
        reader and write method ref stuff.
      - fixed this to use find_or_create_type_constraint
        instead of trying to parse stuff on our own.

    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Collection
      - this is pretty much empty subclass now cause of
        the find_or_create_type_constraint fix above

    + MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Collection::ImmutableHash

      - this is now composed from the ImmutableHash
        method provider

    ~~ more misc. doc updates ~~

    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Counter
      - now provides default attribute options for 'is',
      'isa', 'provides', and 'default' if not specified.

    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Base
      - added attribute $name to the params passed to
        process_options_or_provides(), which gives us more
        flexibility when writing additional helpers
      - removed check for 'provides' and 'isa' attr
        options before _process_options. It should be
        called always.

      - added `delete` and `insert` methods

0.02 Thurs. Sept. 13, 2007

    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Base
      - now providing subrefs for the reader and writer
        methods to all the method provider constructors

    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Counter
      - added the 'reset' method

    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Collection::Array
      - Extracted the List method provider role from
        Array and made Array consume List.

        derived from parts of the old Collection::Array
