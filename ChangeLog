Revision history for Perl extension MooseX-AttributeHelpers

0.02 Thurs. Sept. 13, 2007
    ~~ some misc. doc updates ~~

    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Base
      - now providing subrefs for the reader and writer 
        methods to all the method provider constructors
        (this should speed things up quite a bit).
        - all method providers now use this internally

    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Counter
      - added the 'reset' method 
    
    * MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Collection::Array
      - Extracted the List method provider role from 
        Array and made Array consume List.

    + MooseX::AttributeHelpers::Collection::List
      - created the Collection::List metaclass
        derived from parts of the old Collection::Array
